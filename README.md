# Work-Day-Scheduler
## Description

A work day scheduler where you can type tasks you need to do during certain hours of the work week, and save each task to local storage using the save buttons

## Installation

Nothing special is needed to install. It's just an HTML, CSS, Javascript, and some picture assets.

## Usage

You can view the published webpage [here](https://spawze.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/)  

Type your task into each slot on the page, and click the save button to save them to local storage. Times that are past will be gray, times that are now are red, and times in the future are green.
